# machine-learned
# This file's purpose is to execute a K-Nearest Neighbors split given a tuple with X-coordinates, Y-coordinates, and a k value. 
# This is to be done without the use of an algorithm. First distance was found, and then the "k" lowest values were taken.
# Then, the color (out of 2) that appears the most in the odd "k" tuples is spit out, and the point given is classified.
# This can be fairly easily modified to take a large file with many values in a tuple.
